# Image-Captioning
The following project takes in images and returns the caption for image

# The purpose of this project is to help visually impaired in identifying objects and actions in an image.
The aim of this project is to construct a neural network architecture (CNN Encoder- RNN Decoder) which generates captions from images automatically. 

Built using technologies of two subdomains of Machine Learning : Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

# Trained on Flickr8k dataset and the network is tested on the novel images to give 82.4 percent accuracy.

The model gave the following results
